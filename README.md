# AWS Data Engineering Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my AWS Data Engineering portfolio! This repository showcases projects that leverage AWS services to build scalable, efficient, and data-driven solutions. Here, you'll find examples of data pipelines, ETL processes, and analytics workflows, demonstrating best practices in data engineering.

## Projects
1. **Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kinesis and Lambda**  
   - Implements a serverless data ingestion pipeline using **Amazon Kinesis** and **AWS Lambda**.
   - Processes streaming data efficiently and stores it in **Amazon S3** for analysis.

2. **ETL Pipeline Using AWS Glue and Redshift**  
   - Automates data extraction, transformation, and loading using **AWS Glue**.
   - Stores processed data in **Amazon Redshift** for querying and reporting.

3. **Data Lake Architecture on AWS**  
   - Sets up a scalable data lake using **Amazon S3**, **AWS Lake Formation**, and **Athena**.
   - Enables efficient querying of structured and semi-structured data.

4. **Batch Processing Pipeline with AWS Step functions**  
   - Orchestrates data workflows using **Step functions**.
   - Schedules and monitors complex batch processing tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS Services:** S3, Glue, Redshift, Lambda, Kinesis, Athena 
- **Data Processing:** Apache Spark, Pandas, SQL  
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform, CloudFormation  
- **Orchestration:** Step functions 

## How to Use
